# ShowingLayers
A simple demonstration on how Spring boot helps manage the layers. In this case, I have implemented 3 layers but with static data. In the project propertis , you will see that am directing the connection to port 8084. Helps understand also how to use the core model of Spring Boot that is IOC such as @Autowired and others.
